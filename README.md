## How to Play Star Shooter

### Objective
*   Collect the two keys scattered across the grid, found on planets.
*   Once both keys are collected, a powerful boss will appear.
*   Defeat the boss to win the game!
*   Be careful: running out of fuel, letting the boss reach you, or exceeding the maximum date will result in a game over.

### Controls
*   **Arrow Keys (UP/DOWN):** Move your ship forward and backward.
*   **Arrow Keys (LEFT/RIGHT):** Rotate your ship.
*   **Spacebar:** Fire your laser (consumes a small amount of fuel).
*   **N Key:** Fire a missile (limited supply, restock at bases).
*   **W Key:** Toggle warp targeting mode. In this mode, use arrow keys to select a target sector, then press 'W' again to warp (consumes fuel based on distance).
*   **H Key:** Warp to a random sector (consumes a fixed amount of fuel).
*   **M Key:** Open the galactic map. In map mode, use arrow keys to move a targeting cursor, then press 'Spacebar' to fire a long-range missile at an enemy in the targeted sector (consumes a missile). Press 'M' again to exit map mode.

### On-Screen Displays
*   **Cockpit View:** Your primary view of the 3D space, now with an immersive cockpit frame.
*   **Fuel Gauge:** Located on the right side of the cockpit, shows your remaining fuel.
*   **Missile Count:** Displays how many missiles you have left.
*   **Key Count:** Shows how many keys you've collected out of the total (e.g., "Keys: 1/2").
*   **Shield:** Displays your current shield strength.
*   **Score:** Your current score.
*   **Date:** The in-game date, which advances with certain actions.
*   **Map (Bottom Left):** A 2D grid representing the universe.
    *   Yellow Circle: Your current position.
    *   Blue Squares: Starbases (dock here to refuel and restock missiles).
    *   Yellow Squares: Planets with keys.
    *   Blue Circles: Planets without keys.
    *   Gray Circles: Asteroid fields (flying into them will damage your shield).
*   **Radar (Bottom Right):** Detects nearby objects.
    *   Red Dots: Fighter enemy ships.
    *   Orange Squares: Bomber enemy ships.
    *   Light Gray Rectangles: Cruiser enemy ships.
    *   Magenta Dot: The Boss (appears after collecting all keys).

## Sound Generation

The game's sound effects are procedurally generated by `generate_sounds.py`. This script creates `.wav` files for various in-game actions (laser, missile, explosion, warp, game over, win) and places them in the `assets/sounds/` directory. You must run this script once after installation to ensure all sound assets are available.
